## NeoPixel_HD FeatherWing PCB
More Information and Images also here: https://hackaday.io/project/168448


Inspired and based on Adafruit's NeoPixel FeatherWing, but with more Pixels!

This is the NeoPixel FeatherWing, a 9x22 RGB LED Add-on For All Feather Boards! Using our Feather Stacking Headers or Feather Female Headers you can connect a FeatherWing on top or bottom of your Feather board and make your Feather board strut like a peacock at a rave.

Put on your sunglasses before staring into these 198 configurable eye-blistering RGB LEDs. Arranged in a 9x22 matrix, each pixel is individually addressable. Only one pin is required to control all the LEDs. On the bottom we have jumpers for the DIN line to any of the I/O pins on a Feather.  Works with any/all of our Feathers! You can cut the default jumper trace and use any pin you like. (In particular, the default pin for Feather Huzzah ESP8266 must be moved, try pin #15!) It works with but is not recommended for ESP32 Feather at this time due to a NeoPixel timing issue that makes it hard to control more than 30 pixels
